# EAT!
## A simple Python game (using Pygame) inspired from the Google Play game, Hot Balloon and a little bit from Pac Man.
###### To run this game, you need to click on Code and then download the zip. Extract it and open the assets file in VSC. After opening the assets file, open main.py and play it!

###### The plus signs (+) gives you point while the negative sign (-) subtracts a point. The bomb is an obstacle that you MUST avoid and if not, the game will end.
