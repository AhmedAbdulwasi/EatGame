# EAT!
A simple Python game (using Pygame) inspired from the Google Play game, Hot Balloon and a little bit from Pac Man. I've created my own sound effects and characters (images) and edited them using Photoshop and Premiere Pro so please forgive me if it looks bad. The only thing that is not mine is the fonts.

## To run this game:
- You need to click on Code and then download the zip. 
- Extract it and open the assets file in VSC. 
- After opening the assets file, open main.py and play it!

The plus signs (+) gives you a point while the negative sign (-) subtracts a point. The bomb is an obstacle that you MUST avoid and if not, the game will end. You can click space to continue or close off the application.

If you want to leave the game at ANY point, click the red x button (exit) on the top right of the program.

## Why?
I was playing Hot Balloon while I was in a subway train and I had the idea of creating a similar one but with more points (such as + and -) which the game lacked. I also wanted to make something that includes my own drawings and sound effects to show a little of originality.

## Languages and Technologies
- Python (Pygame)
